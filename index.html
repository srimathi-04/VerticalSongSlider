                <h1>Love Story <br> 2008</h1>
                <p>We were both young when I first saw you<br>
                    I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
                    I'm standing there<br>
                    On a balcony in summer air</p>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1>You Belong With Me <br> 2008</h1>
                <p>If you could see that I'm the one<br>
                    Who understands you<br>
                    Been here all along<br>
                    So, why can't you see?<br>
                    You belong with me....
                </p>

                <h1>Enchanted <br> 2010</h1>
                <p>This is me praying that<br>
                    This was the very first page<br>
                    Not where the story line ends<br>
                    My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again<br>
                    These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon<br>
                    I was enchanted to meet you<br>
                    Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
                    Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
                    Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
                    Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>

                <h1>BlankSpace <br> 2014</h1>
                <p>Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br>
                    I can make all the tables turn<br>
                    Rose garden filled with thorns<br>
                    Keep you second guessing like<br>
                    "Oh, my God, who is she?"<br>
                    I get drunk on jealousy<br>
                    But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
                    'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream</p>
            </div>

                <h1>Lover<br> 2019</h1>
                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
                    With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
                    I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover<br>
                    My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
                    All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
                    Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover</p>
